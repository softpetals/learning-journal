You can evaluate a situation by comparing one value in the scrip to what you expect it might be. Theresult will be a Boolean: true or false.

== is equalto 
This operator comparestwo values (numbers, strings, or Booleans)to see if they are the same. 

=== is strict equal to
This operator compares two values to check that both the data type and the value are the same. 

!=  is not equal to
This operator compares two values (numbers, strings, or Booleans)to see if they are not the same.

!==  is strict not equal to
This operator compares two values to check that both the data type and the value are not the same. 

>  greater than
This operator checks if the number on the left is greater than the number on the right. 

<  less than
This operator checks if the number on the left is less than the number on the right.

>= greater than or equal to 
This operator checks if the number on the left is greater than or equal to the number on the right.

<= less than or equal to
This operator checks if the number on the left is less than or equal to the number on the right.


Programmers refer to the testing or checking of a condition as evaluating the condition. 

LOGICAL OPERATORS allow you to compare the results of more than one comparison operator. They look like this 

&&  logical and
This operator tests more than one condition

 ||  logican or
 This operator tests at least one condition. 

 !  logical not
 This operator takes a single Boolean value and inverts it.

 Logical expressions are evaluated left to right. If the first condition can provie enough information to get the answer, then there is no need to evaluate the second condition. 

Loops check a condition. If it returns true, a code block will run. Then the condition will be checked again and if it stills returns true, the code block will run again. It repeats until the condition returns false. 

There are three common types of loops.
1. For - if you need to run code a specific number of times, use a for loop.
2. While -if you do not know how many times the code should run, you can use a while loop. 
3. do while - the do...while loop is similar to while loop, but has one key difference: it will always run the statements inside the curly braces at least once, even if the condition evaluates to false.
