- rgb value- express colors in terms of how much red, green and blue are being used to make it up. Example rgb(100,100,90)
- rgba- allows you to specify a color, just like you would with RGB value, but adds a fourth value to indicate opacity.
- alpha value- is the last letter of rgba and it allows to control opacity through a numerical value (0.5 is 50% opacity and 0.15 is 15%)
