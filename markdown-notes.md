## What is Markdown?

Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You can control the dispay of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do in Markdown. 
You can use markdown most place around Github.

### Examples

**bold** 
*italic*
[link to google](http://google.com)
# This is an <h1> tag
## This is an <h2> tag
### This is an <h3> tag and so on. 
_this text will also be italic_
__this will also be bold__
_You **can** combine them_

#### Lists can be Ordered and Unordered
* Item 1
* Item 2
  * Item 2a
  * Item 2b  is unordered

1. Item 1
1. Item 2
1. Item 3
   1. Item 3a
   1. Item 3b is ordered

#### Images

#### Blockquotes
As Kanye West said:

> We're living the future so
> the present is our past.

#### Inline code
I think you should use an
`<addr>` element here instead.


















A text editor is a piece of software that you download or install on your computer, or you
Access online through your web browser, that allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write to build a web site. 
You should look for these features in text editors
- Code completion
- Syntax highlighting
- A nice variety of themes(to reduce eyestrain and fatigue)
- The ability to chose from a healthy selection of extensions available when you need them.

TERMINAL

A command line, or terminal, is a text based interface to the system. You are able to enter commands by typing them on the keyboard and feedback will be given to you similarly as text.

Shortcuts in command

-When you enter commands, they are actually stored in a history. You can traverse this history using the up and down arrow keys. So don't bother re-typing out commands you have previously entered, you can usually just hit the up arrow a few times. You can also edit these commands using the left and right arrow keys to move the cursor where you want.
-If you run the command cd without any arguments then it will always take you back to your home directory.


COMMANDS
* /etc - Stores config files for the system.
* /var/log - Stores log files for various system programs. (You may not have permission to look at everything in this directory. Don't let that stop you exploring though. A few error messages never hurt anyone.)
* /bin - The location of several commonly used programs (some of which we will learn about in the rest of this tutorial.
* /usr/bin - Another location for programs on the system.
	file -obtain information about what type of file a file or directory is.
   	ls -a List the contents of a directory, including hidden files.
	mkdir [options] <Directory>.   To make a directory
	rmdir [options] <Directory>	      To remove a directory
	touch [options] <filename>	      To create a blank file. 
	cp [options] <source> <destination>	     Copying a file to directory
	mv [options] <source> <destination>.    Moving a file into directory
	rm [options] <file>     removing a file from a none empty directory.  
	
### Markdown Notes
- `#` creates a level 1 heading
- `######`  creates a level 6 heading
- `- * and +` symbols all create unordered list
- `1.` creates ordered list and always best to use the number 1
